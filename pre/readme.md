- **cal_gic.py**: In this file, we run the code using files `ncName_ncID_transID.csv`, `eng.csv `and `transcripts_seq.fasta`, which are stored in the `data/human` or  `data/mouse`  folder. The result from running the code are stored in the `result/human` and `result/mouse` folder, named `GIC_score.csv`.

- **idmap.py**: In this file, we run the code using `LPI.csv`, which are stored in `data/human` or  `data/mouse` folder.  This code generates three files,` id_lncRNA.txt`, `id_protein.txt` and `id_lncRNA_protein.txt` .  The results are stored in` data/human` and  `data/mouse`folder. 

- **pro_path.py**: In this file, we use the code using `positive.csv` , `negative.csv` , which  are stored in `result/human`or `result/mouse` folder.  This code also uses text file generated by `metapath2vec.cpp`, e.g., `out_mouse_400_100.txt` are stored in `result/mouse/para/400_100_64`. This code generates  files `dataset1.csv`, e.g. these files are stored in  `result/mouse/para/400_100_64`.
